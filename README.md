### Local Development Mode - Setup Guide

It's possible to setup a blank instance of this job board locally. This is a local development mode and it's different from the way the app runs in production. In this scenario the app runs on a minimal database containing mock data. The app has reduced functionality when ran in local development mode. It's not possible to send emails or connect to third party services, like Twitter, Telegram and FX APIs. It's still possible to run and test the app but with limited functionality.

**Requirements**

These are basic requirements with the respective versions have been tested to work locally on MacOS. The same should apply both on Linux and WSL/Windows.

- Bash 3.2.x or higher
- Docker 20.10.x or higher
- Go 1.15.x or higher

**Dependencies**

- **PostgreSQL instance** mocked using local Docker container, with local schema and fixtures
- **Sparkpost Mail** emails are sent using http requests through Sparkpost APIs. This is not enabled in local development mode.
- **Telegram API** telegram updates are sent through the Job Board official Telegram channel. This is not enabled in local development mode.
- **Twitter API** twitter updates are sent through the Job Board official page. This is not enabled in local development mode.
- **LinkedIn API** LinkedIn updates are sent through the Job Board official page. This is not enabled in local development mode. Requires:
  - "Share on LinkedIn" product
  - "Sign In with LinkedIn" product, with `<siteUrl>/manage/linkedin/callback` set as an "Authorized redirect URLs for your app"
- **FX API** a minimal set of Foreign Currency Exchange data is kept up-to-date to filter out salary ranges. This is not enabled in local development mode.

**Setup Guide**

The only thing that needs to be setup in order for the app to run is the PostgreSQL database instance. Please run the following command in order to setup your local database instance.

```
./setup-database.sh
```

Once this command is successful you can now start the application

```
./run-local-webserver.sh
```

**Test Cron-Jobs Locally**

There are a few cron-jobs that are triggered on a schedule, these are scheduled externally via custom http calls to the website. You can see all available cron-jobs by searching for all routes that start with /x/task/<task-name>.

In order to test a cron-job you can just make the following http request

```
curl -v -H 'x-machine-token: <machine-token>' -X POST http://localhost:9876/x/task/<task-name>
```

You can find the <machine-token> under your local environment variable configuration, in the `MACHINE_TOKEN` environment variable.
